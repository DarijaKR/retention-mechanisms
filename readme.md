# How to use retention mechanism script (rm.py)

## Install Python version 3 for your operating system

Download Python installer from this link and install it on your machine (if not installed previously):\
https://www.python.org/downloads
This script can work with Python 2, but it is recommended to use it with Python 3.

## Install Python packages that are used in the script

### Run these commands:

>pip install numpy\
>pip install matplotlib\
>pip install pandas\
>pip install scipy

## Run the script (without input)

>python3 rm.py

## Pass input values to the script

In order to pass the input values to the script, use either CSV file with name **input.csv** or send the values via
command line using comma separated values.

Script can only accept numbers as input values.

### Example using CSV file (input.csv):

>xInput,yInput\
>0.06,0.1\
>0.08,0.2\
>0.1,0.3\
>0.12,0.4

**Note**: It is mandatory to name columns as **xInput** and **yInput**.

### Example with sending the values via command line arguments

python3 rm.py 0.06,0.08,0.1,0.12 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4

## Results and errors

If input values are sent correctly, script will show 4 plots with **Dual**, **Quadratic**, **HILIC** and **RP-HPLC** models respectively.\
Winers for **HILIC** and **RP-HPLC** models will be shown in the plots.\
Calculated values will also be stored in files **output-dual-model.csv**, **output-quadratic-model.csv**, **output-rp-hplc.csv** and **output-hilic.csv**.

If there is an error during the script run, it will be written in console (command line or terminal).
